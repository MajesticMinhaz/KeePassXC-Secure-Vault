# KeePassXC Secure Vault

This repository is used to securely store and version-control the latest KeePassXC database (`Passwords.kdbx`).

## Features

- Automatically commits and pushes the latest KeePassXC database to a private Git repository.
- Ensures the most recent password database is backed up.
- Can be automated using a cron job or systemd timer.

## How to Use

### 1. **Setup**

Clone this repository (if not already):

Change to $HOME to avoid issues if you're inside the KeePassXC-Secure-Vault directory
```bash
cd ~ 

if [ -d ~/KeePassXC-Secure-Vault ]; then
    read -p "Directory exists. Do you want to overwrite it? (y/n): " choice
    if [ "$choice" = "y" ]; then
        rm -rf ~/KeePassXC-Secure-Vault
        git clone git@github.com:MajesticMinhaz/KeePassXC-Secure-Vault.git ~/KeePassXC-Secure-Vault
    else
        echo "Keeping existing directory."
        cd ~/KeePassXC-Secure-Vault && git pull
    fi
else
    git clone git@github.com:MajesticMinhaz/KeePassXC-Secure-Vault.git ~/KeePassXC-Secure-Vault
fi

cd ~/KeePassXC-Secure-Vault && chmod +x ~/KeePassXC-Secure-Vault/update_keepass.sh

```

Place your KeePassXC database (`Passwords.kdbx`) inside this directory.

### 2. **Run the Backup Script**
Before running, ensure the script has execute permissions and to update and push the latest KeePassXC database run:

```bash
~/KeePassXC-Secure-Vault/update_keepass.sh
```

This will:\
âœ… Copy the latest database from `~/Documents/Passwords.kdbx`\
âœ… Check for changes\
âœ… Commit and push the update

### 3. **Automate with Cron (Optional)**

To run the backup script daily at 10 PM, add this to your crontab:

```sh
crontab -e  
```

Then add:

```sh
0 22 * * * /home/minhaz/keepassxc-secure-vault/update_keepass.sh  
```

### 4. **Restore the Database**

If you need to restore your database on another device:

Change to $HOME to avoid issues if you're inside the KeePassXC-Secure-Vault directory
```bash
cd ~

if [ -d ~/KeePassXC-Secure-Vault ]; then
    read -p "Directory exists. Do you want to overwrite it? (y/n): " choice
    if [ "$choice" = "y" ]; then
        rm -rf ~/KeePassXC-Secure-Vault
        git clone git@github.com:MajesticMinhaz/KeePassXC-Secure-Vault.git ~/KeePassXC-Secure-Vault
    else
        echo "Keeping existing directory."
        cd ~/KeePassXC-Secure-Vault && git pull
    fi
else
    git clone git@github.com:MajesticMinhaz/KeePassXC-Secure-Vault.git ~/KeePassXC-Secure-Vault
fi

cd ~/KeePassXC-Secure-Vault && cp ./Passwords.kdbx ~/Documents/

```

## Security Notes

- Ensure this repository is **private** to protect your encrypted database.
- Your KeePassXC master password is required to open the database.

ðŸš€ **Now your KeePassXC database is safely backed up and version-controlled!**
